#### Anti-spam ruleset ###########################################
# This script provides some foundational anti-spam
# rules. It does not do any form of content filtering,
# but this can be implemented by other scripts and
# modules as desired.
#
# The following chains are available as extension
# points:
#
# ::user/spam_check_message_custom
#   Apply additional rules to messages from strangers
#
# ::user/spam_check_message_content
#   Apply additional rules to messages that may be spam
#
# ::user/spam_check_presence_custom
#   Apply additional rules to presence that may be spam
#
# ::user/spam_check_subscription_request
#   Apply additional rules to subscription requests
#
# ::user/spam_handle_unknown_custom
#   Override default handling of stanzas that weren't explicitly
#   passed or rejected by the anti-spam checks
#
# ::user/spam_reject_custom
#   Override default handling of stanzas that have
#   been recognised as spam (default is to bounce
#   a policy-violation error)
#
