summary: 'Silly little module to convert your conversations to "swedish"'
...

Introduction
============

This module does some conversions on message bodys passed through it
causing them to look like our beloved swedish chef had typed them.

Details
=======

To load this on a MUC component do

    Component "funconference.example.com" "muc"
        modules_enabled = { "swedishchef" }
        swedishchef_trigger = "!chef"; -- optional, converts only when the message starts with "!chef"

In theory this also works for whole servers, but that is untested and
not recommended ;)

Compatibility
=============

  ----- -------
  0.6   Works
  0.5   Works

Todo
====

-   Possibly add xhtml-im (XEP-0071) support
