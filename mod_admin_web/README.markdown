summary: Web administration interface
...

Introduction
============

This module provides a basic web administration interface. It currently
gives you access to Ad-Hoc commands on any virtual host or component
that you are set as an administrator for in the Prosody config file. It
also provides a live list of all S2S and C2S connections.

Installation
============

1.  Copy the admin\_web directory into a directory Prosody will check
    for plugins. (cf. [Installing
    modules](http://prosody.im/doc/installing_modules))
2.  Execute the contained get\_deps.sh script from within the admin\_web
    directory. (Requires wget, tar, and a basic shell)

Configuration Details
=====================

"admin\_web" needs to be added to the modules\_enabled table of the host
you want to load this module on.

By default the interface will then be reachable under
`http://example.com:5280/admin`, or `https://example.com:5281/admin`.

The module will automatically enable two other modules if they aren't
already: mod\_bosh (used to connect to the server from the web), and
mod\_admin\_adhoc (which provides admin commands over XMPP).

    VirtualHost "example.com"
       modules_enabled = {
           .....
           "admin_web";
           .....
       }
