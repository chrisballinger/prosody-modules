Introduction
============

Sometimes it's useful to have different interfaces to access XMPP.

This is example of sending message using HTTP POST to XMPP. For sure we
need user auth information.

Example usage
-------------

    curl http://example.com:5280/msg/user -u me@example.com:mypassword -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "Server@host has just crashed!"

This would send a message to user@example.com from me@example.com
