This module pushes the users nickname and avatar from vCards into PEP,
or into vCards from PEP. This allows interop between older clients that
use [XEP-0153: vCard-Based
Avatars](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html) to see the avatars of
clients that use [XEP-0084: User
Avatar](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html) and vice versa.

Configuration
-------------

Simply [enable it like most other
modules](https://prosody.im/doc/installing_modules#prosody-modules), no
further configuration needed.
