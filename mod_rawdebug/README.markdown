summary: Telnet command for raw stanza logging
...

Summary
-------

Sometimes it is useful to get the raw XML logs from clients for
debugging purpouses, but some cliens don't expose this. This command
lets you activate this on specific sessions.

Usage
-----

In the telnet console:

    c2s:show()
    | example.com
    |    user@example.com/bd0b8b19 [c2sb75e93d8] available(0) (encrypted)
    |    ...
    | OK: Total: $n clients


    rawdebug:enable"user@example.com/bd0b8b19"
    > OK

Then everything sent and received will be logged to debug levels.
