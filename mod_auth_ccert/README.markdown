summary: Client Certificate authentication module
...

Introduction
============

This module implements PKI-style client certificate authentication. You
will therefore need your own Certificate Authority. How to set that up
is beyond the current scope of this document.

Configuration
=============


    authentication = "ccert"
    certificate_match = "xmppaddr" -- or "email"

    c2s_ssl = {
        capath = "/path/to/dir/with/your/ca"
    }

`capath` should be pointed to a directory with your own CA certificate.
You will need to run `c_rehash` in it.

Compatibility
=============
