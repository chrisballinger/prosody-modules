summary: Provides a web interface to stored chatroom logs
...

Introduction
============

This module provides a built-in web interface to view chatroom logs
stored by [mod\_mam\_muc](mod_mam_muc.md).

Installation
============

Just copy the folder muc\_log\_http as it is, into the modules folder of
your Prosody installation.

Configuration Details
=====================

You need to add muc\_log\_http to your global modules\_enabled, and the
configuration options similarly must be put into your global
(server-wide) options section:

        Component "conference.example.com" "muc"
        modules_enabled = {
            .....
            "mam_muc";
            "http_muc_log";
            .....
        }
        storage = {
            muc_log = "sql2"; -- for example
        }

The web interface would then be reachable at the address:

    http://conference.example.com:5280/muc_log/

See [the page about Prosodys HTTP server](http://prosody.im/doc/http)
for info about the address.

Compatibility
=============

Requires Prosody 0.10 or above and a storage backend with support for
stanza archives.
