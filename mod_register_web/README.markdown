summary: A web interface to register user accounts
...

Introduction
------------

There are various reasons to prefer web registration instead of
"in-band" account registration over XMPP. For example the lack of
CAPTCHA support in clients and servers.

Details
-------

mod\_register\_web has Prosody serve a web page where users can sign up
for an account. It implements reCaptcha to prevent automated sign-ups
(from bots, etc.).

Configuration
-------------

The module is served on Prosody's default HTTP ports at the path
`/register_web`. More details on configuring HTTP modules in Prosody can
be found in our [HTTP documentation](http://prosody.im/doc/http).

To configure the CAPTCHA you need to supply a 'captcha\_options' option:

        captcha_options = {
          recaptcha_private_key = "12345";
          recaptcha_public_key = "78901";
        }

The keys for reCaptcha are available in your reCaptcha account, visit
[recaptcha.net](http://recaptcha.net/) for more info.

If no reCaptcha options are set, a simple built in captcha is used.

Todo

Lots. The module is very basic at the moment. In particular I would like
to see:

Customisation (CSS and/or HTML)

Different CAPTCHA implementation support

Collection of additional data, such as email address

The module kept simple!
