summary: 'Replacement for mod\_vcard with vcard4 support and PEP integration'
...

Introduction
============

This module provides a replacement for mod\_vcard. In addition to the
ageing protocol defined by
[XEP-0054](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0054.html), it also supports
the [new vCard 4 based
protocol](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0292.html) and integrates with
[Personal Eventing Protocol](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html).
The vCard 4, [User Avatar](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html) and
[User Nickname](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0172.html) PEP nodes are
updated when the vCard is changed..

Configuration
=============

    modules_enabled = {
        -- "pep";   -- These two modules must be removed
        -- "vcard";

        "profile";
    }

Compatibility
=============

Compatible with trunk after 2014-05-29.

It depends on the new mod\_pep\_plus for PEP support.
