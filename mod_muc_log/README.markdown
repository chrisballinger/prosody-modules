summary: Log chatroom messages to disk
...

Introduction
============

This module logs the conversation of chatrooms running on the server to
Prosody's data store. To view them you will need a module such as
[mod\_muc\_log\_http](mod_muc_log_http.html).

Details
=======

mod\_muc\_log must be loaded individually for the components that need
it. Assuming you have a MUC component already running on
conference.example.org then you can add muc\_log to it like so:

    Component "conference.example.org" "muc"
       modules_enabled = {
          "muc_log";
       }

Logging is not enabled by default. In 0.9+ logging can be enabled per
room in the room config form.

To enable logging in older versions, or to enable logging by default for
all rooms, set

    muc_log_by_default = true -- Log all rooms by default
