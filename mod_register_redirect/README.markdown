Introduction
------------

Registration Redirect as explained in the [IBR
XEP](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html#redirect).

Details
-------

This module shows instructions on how to register to the server, should
it be necessary to perform it through other means Out-Of-Band or not,
and also let's registrations origining from ip addresses in the
whitelist to go through normally.

Usage
-----

Copy the module file into your Prosody modules directory.

The module will work "out of the box" as long as at least an admin entry
is specified (see admins = {} option into prosody's documentation).These
are the optional parameters you can specify into your global
server/hostname configuration:

    registration_whitelist = { "*your whitelisted web server ip address*" }
    registrarion_url = "*your web registration page url*"
    registration_text = "Your custom instructions banner here"
    registration_oob = true (default) or false, in the case there's no applicable OOB method (e.g. the server admins needs to be contacted by phone)

To not employ any whitelisting (i.e. registration is handled
externally).

    no_registration_whitelist = true
