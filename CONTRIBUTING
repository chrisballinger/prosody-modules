Guidelines for developers
-------------------------

-   Each module should be contained in a folder of its name (e.g.\
     `mod_ping/mod_ping.lua`)
-   Each module should have a `README.markdown` page in their folder
    with a description, usage, configuration and todo sections (feel
    free to copy an existing one as a template)
-   Commit messages should begin with the name of the plugin they are
    for (e.g. `mod_ping: Set correct namespace on pongs`)
