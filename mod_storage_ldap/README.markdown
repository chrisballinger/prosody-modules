Introduction
============

See [mod\_lib\_ldap](mod_lib_ldap.md) for more information.

Installation
============

You must install [mod\_lib\_ldap](mod_lib_ldap.md) to use this module.
After that, you need only copy mod\_storage\_ldap.lua and
ldap/vcard.lib.lua to your Prosody installation's plugins directory.
Make sure vcard.lib.lua is installed under plugins/ldap/.

Configuration
=============

In addition to the configuration that [mod\_lib\_ldap](mod_lib_ldap.md)
itself requires, this plugin also requires the following fields in the
ldap section:

-   user.namefield
-   groups.memberfield
-   groups.namefield
-   groups.basedn
-   vcard\_format (optional)

See the README.md distributed with [mod\_lib\_ldap](mod_lib_ldap.md) for
details.
